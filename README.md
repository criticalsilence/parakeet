parakeet project aims to create a blockchain based *egg and sperm donation* network on a global scale.

## what is problem ?
Wikipedia defines third-party reproduction as ‘‘any human reproduction in which DNA or gestation is provided by a third party or donor other than the two parents who will be raising the child’’. It is true that treatment with sperm donation has been used for over a century, but it was the innovation of IVF (In vitro fertilization) leading to such advances as oocyte donation, gestational surrogacy, and embryo donation that truly brought the term to the forefront.

The purely medical perspective on egg donation showcases a highly successful treatment for infertility, with few medical complications for donor, recipient, and baby. The present Views and Reviews argues that this purely medical perspective has been based on three mostly unstated assumptions that require reexamination. First, it has been assumed that it is the decision of the parents whether the offspring will know they were donor conceived. Second, it has been assumed that in most cases the donor will remain anonymous. Third, it has been assumed that there will be no contact among the parties.

How adults from egg donation (i.e., those that were conceived in 1984–2000, the early days of egg donation) feel today may be radically different from the next generation. For example, not being told about one's donor origins may carry very different meaning in a context in which nondisclosure and anonymity was the norm than in a time when openness is recommended, anonymity questioned, and contact reasonably possible, as it is today. Therefore, to address the needs of the next generation them from need to facilitate further. However, given that unpredictable complexities can arise, it is also reasonable to wait until there is in fact a child born from the arrangement and that both parties still desire contact once the reality of the child born from the donation sets in psychologically.
