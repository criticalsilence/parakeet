# parakeet
parakeet  aims to create a ethereum based egg and sperm donation network on a global scale.

> I opened this repository to learn how to write code. I'm thinking of improving the project and learning code at the same time. so the page will be updated frequently. I would be grateful if your help came.

## what is my purpose and why?
[Egg donation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_donation) is often used for women whose ovaries have either been surgically removed or are functioning poorly. Poor function can be due to premature menopause, severe diminished ovarian reserve, medical disorders, or exposure to toxins like chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Egg donation also is appropriate for women who were born without ovaries.

Other uses for egg donation have emerged in recent years. It is sometimes used to avoid passing down inherited diseases to a womanâ€™s children. Egg donation also is used for women who have normal ovulation, but who have poor-quality eggs, for instance, women who have had multiple failed IVF cycles, women of advanced reproductive age (over age 38), and women with low response to medications for ovarian stimulation.

## so?
will be update..
